# üß† Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** repository by [Nuthan Reddy](https://github.com/Nuthanreddy05). This repo includes a collection of ML and deep learning projects and assignments, implemented using Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and other tools. The goal is to understand key ML concepts and apply them to real-world datasets and problems.
